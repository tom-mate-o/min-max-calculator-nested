I created a [GitHub Fork](https://github.com/tom-mate-o/min-max-calculator-nested) and adapted the calculator to output the clamp function nested with a calc function. This allows [me](https://github.com/tom-mate-o) to use it in a Joomla/YooTheme environment with SASS.

The original project is by [9elements](https://9elements.com) and was created by [Nesim](https://nes.im/) and [Nils](https://twitter.com/supremebeing09). It can be found [here](https://min-max-calculator.9elements.com/).

[9elements](https://9elements.com) uses [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi) in many of their projects to create fluid scales for type and spacing using [CSS clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) and not relying on media queries.

Even this website that youâ€™re visiting right now uses a type scale generated by the handy tool created by [James Gilyead](https://www.hustlersquad.net/) & [Trys Mudford](https://www.trysmudford.com/).
